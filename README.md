## Design and implementation

PSOC&trade; 4  has many digital signals generated from different peripheral blocks. Many of these signals need to be routed to other peripheral blocks as triggers to some events there. Trigger multiplexers are simple multiplexers designed to route these signals from potential source peripherals to destinations. This example demonstrates setting up a trigger route from PWM to DMA.

The design implements a PWM with a duty cycle updated on every terminal count of the PWM through a DMA. A preset list of compare values are kept in an array. These preset compare values are in a format that, when updated as the compare value of the PWM in every cycle, generates a breathing pattern. The array with compare values is the source of data transfer for the DMA; the destination is the PWM’s compare register. The DMA is triggered using the PWM’s terminal count signal. The routing of the terminal count signal to the trigger input of the DMA is accomplished using the trigger multiplexer.

You need to connect the PWM overflow trigger (ovrflw) to the DMA input trigger (tr_in). The ModusToolbox&trade; software device configurator  takes care of generating the code responsible for routing the trigger signal. See [Trigger multiplexer](#trigger-multiplexer) for details.


### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------- | :-------------    | :------------
 TCPWM (PWM)       | USER_PWM         | PWM to drive the user LED
 DMA               | USER_DMA         | DMA channel to update the PWM compare value
 GPIO              | CYBSP_USER_LED1   | LED to show the output

<br>


## Resource settings


### DMA configuration

A DMA channel is used to transfer the compare values from the array to the PWM compare register. The configuration is shown in **Figure 1**.

**Figure 1. DMA configuration**

![](images/dma.png)

The trigger input to the DMA is connected to the PWM overflow trigger output. The trigger output is not used. Descriptor Ping is retained as the active descriptor.

The DMA implements a simple array to a single register transfer, which can be achieved using a single descriptor. Only the ping descriptor is required in this case. This descriptor transfers a 251-element array to a single compare register over 251 triggers. Therefore, the data count is set as 251. Because the data source is an array, the address needs to be incremented after each transfer. Therefore, the source address increment is set. The destination is a constant compare register. Therefore, destination increment is not set.

The ping descriptor source and destinations are dynamically updated in the code. Hence, it is not stored in flash.


### TCPWM configuration

**Figure 2. TCPWM configuration**

![](images/tcpwm.png)

The period value of the PWM is set to 65532. The PWM is clocked by a 12 MHz clock and the terminal count is used to trigger the DMA. This period value (65532) ensures that the terminal count, and consequently the DMA trigger, occurs at a frequency of 12/65532 MHz. The breathing rate of the LED is determined by this rate of DMA trigger multiplied by the number of elements in the array of compared values.

The compare value is set to 256 here. However, the compare value is updated later using this DMA. Therefore, this value starts the PWM at a very small duty cycle.


## Trigger multiplexer

The DMA channels can have trigger inputs from different peripheral sources in the PSOC&trade; device. This is routed to the individual DMA channel trigger inputs through the trigger multiplexer. In the DMA trigger, multiplexers are organized into trigger groups. Each trigger group is composed of multiple multiplexers feeding into the individual DMA channel trigger inputs.

The routing of the trigger is achieved by configuring a single trigger group (Trigger group 0), which provides trigger inputs to the DMA.

**Figure 3. Trigger multiplexer architecture**

![](images/triggermux.png)

ModusToolbox&trade; device configurator automatically generates the code required to trigger multiplexer routing. This trigger multiplexer routing code is in *cycfg_routing.c* as part of the `cybsp_init()` function. The following code snippet is from the `cybsp_init()` function of this code example; it shows the `Cy_TrigMux_Connect()` call to connect the PWM overflow output trigger to the DMA input trigger.

```c
Cy_TrigMux_Connect(TRIG0_IN_TCPWM_TR_OVERFLOW2, TRIG0_OUT_CPUSS_DMAC_TR_IN0);
```
