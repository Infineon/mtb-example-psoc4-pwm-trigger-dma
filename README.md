You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional)  Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

This tool has the following arguments:

## Operation

In this example, the intensity of the LED is controlled by changing the duty cycle of the PWM signal. The PWM duty cycle is updated using DMA. The the duty cycle is updated in such a way that a breathing pattern is seen on the LED.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the USB connector.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; softwre</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CKIT-041S-MAX TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

3. See the breathing output on the user LED.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The PSoC&trade; 4 device has many digital signals generated from different peripheral blocks. Many of these signals would need to be routed to other peripheral blocks as triggers to some events there. Trigger multiplexers are simple multiplexers that are designed to route these signals from potential source peripherals to destinations. This example demonstrates setting up a trigger route from the PWM to the DMA.

The design implements a PWM that has a duty cycle that is updated on every terminal count of the PWM through a DMA. There is a preset list of compare values in an array. These preset compare values are in a format that, when updated as the compare value of the PWM in every cycle, will generate a breathing pattern. The array with compare values is the source of data transfer for the DMA; the destination is the PWMâs compare register. The DMA is triggered using the PWMâs terminal count signal. The routing of the terminal count signal to the trigger input of the DMA is accomplished using the trigger multiplexer.

You need to connect the PWM overflow trigger (ovrflw) to the DMA input trigger (tr_in). The ModusToolbox&trade; software device configurator  takes care of generating the code responsible for routing the trigger signal. See [Trigger multiplexer](#trigger-multiplexer).

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource          |  Alias/object     |    Purpose            |
| :---------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------- |
| TCPWM (PWM)       | USER_PWM         | PWM to drive the user LED |
| DMA               | USER_DMA         | DMA channel to update the PWM compare value |
| GPIO              | CYBSP_USER_LED1   | LED to show the output    |

<br>

## Resource settings

### DMA configuration

A DMA channel is used to transfer the compare values from the array to the PWM compare register. The configuration is shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1. DMA configuration**

![](images/dma.png)

The trigger input to the DMA is connected to PWM overflow trigger output. The trigger output is not used. Descriptor Ping is retained as the active descriptor.

The DMA implements a simple array to a single register transfer, which can be achieved by using a single descriptor. Only the ping descriptor is required in this case. This descriptor transfers a 251- element array to a single compare register over 251 triggers. Therefore, the data count is set as 251. Because the data source is an array, the address needs to be incremented after each transfer. Therefore, the source address increment is set. The destination is a constant compare register. Therefore, destination increment is not set.

The ping descriptor source and destinations are dynamically updated in the code. Therefore, it is not stored in flash.


### TCPWM configuration


**Figure 2. TCPWM configuration**

![](images/tcpwm.png)

The period value of the PWM is set to 65532. The PWM is clocked by a 12-MHz clock and the terminal count is used to trigger the DMA. This period value (65532) ensures that the terminal count and consequently the DMA trigger occurs at a frequency of 12/65532 MHz. The breathing rate of the LED will be determined by this rate of DMA trigger multiplied by the number of elements in the array of compare values.

The Compare value is set to 256 here. However, the compare value is updated later using this DMA. Therefore, this value starts the PWM at a very small duty cycle.


## Trigger multiplexer

The DMA channels can have trigger inputs from different
peripheral sources in the PSoC&trade; device. This is routed to the individual DMA channel trigger inputs through the trigger multiplexer. In the DMA trigger, multiplexers are organized in trigger groups. Each trigger group is composed of multiple multiplexers feeding into the individual DMA channel trigger inputs.

The routing of trigger is achieved by configuring  a single trigger group (Trigger group 0), which provides trigger inputs to the DMA.

**Figure 3. Trigger multiplexer architecture**

![](images/triggermux.png)

ModusToolbox&trade; software's device configurator automatically generates the code required for trigger multiplexer routing. This trigger multiplexer routing code is in *cycfg_routing.c* as a part of the `cybsp_init()` function. The following code snippet is from the `cybsp_init()` function of this code example; it shows the `Cy_TrigMux_Connect()` call to connect the PWM overflow output trigger to the DMA input trigger.

```c
Cy_TrigMux_Connect(TRIG0_IN_TCPWM_TR_OVERFLOW2, TRIG0_OUT_CPUSS_DMAC_TR_IN0);
```
